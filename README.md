## Workstation Configuration
This is meant to be a continuation of my sway repo. The end goal is to delete the sway repo and use this instead because Ansible is much easier to manage. Just a few more commits to this and I'll probably be single! More time to work on it!

## WM Themes
Lemon - The lemon config files are what I use for my desktop.
Focused - The focused theme is kinda meant for laptops, I removed a lot of the transparency and rounded corners to try to save space for smaller displays. I would also like to significantly shrink the waybar if I can find a way to shrink the modules. It's not done yet.

## First-time Setup
So eventually I want a playbook that will just automate the entire setup of a workstation, based on the type of machine it is and specific variables that the user can override. I think this would be a cool way to set up computers whenever I get a new one. This could maybe even evolve into trying to create an entire distro remix, but we'll see.
